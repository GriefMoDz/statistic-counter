# Statistic Counter
Formally known as "Online Friends Count", this is a Replugged plug-in that has been ported from Powercord which introduces an interchangeable statistic counter in-between the home button and servers list.

## Features

- Multiple counters (i.e. number of friends online, total number of friends, incoming friend requests, blocked users, and total number of servers joined).
- Auto rotation with a customizable interval - useful for switching between counters without the need of clicking.

## Planned Features
[] Add a settings page
[] Implement a context menu to quickly change settings
