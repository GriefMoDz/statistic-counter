# Statistics Counter
Formally known as "Online Friends Count", this is a Powercord plug-in that introduces a similar sort of counter that used to be displayed in-between the home button and servers list.

## Features

- Multiple counters (i.e. number of friends online, total number of friends, incoming friend requests, blocked users, and total number of servers joined).
- Auto rotation with a customizable interval - useful for switching between counters without the need of clicking.
